# js-docker-api
An api to make docker cli calls from javascript
This is currently a WIP - The skeleton of an API for docker commands is created, a more fleshed-out api for docker-compose is being written along the same pattern.
See the class documentation in the dist/docs folder.

The DockerCompose API is currently closest to what we're aiming for, The Docker api is still at the prototype stage. Much of the API is untested, espsecially the less travelled command arguments.
